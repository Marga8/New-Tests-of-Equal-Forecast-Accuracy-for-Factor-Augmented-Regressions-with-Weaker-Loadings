# New-Tests-of-Equal-Forecast-Accuracy-for-Factor-Augmented-Regressions-with-Weaker-Loadings

In this README file we explain in details how to reproduce both the simulations and the empirical results in "New Tests of Equal Forecast Accuracy for Factor Augmented Regressions with Weaker Loadings", International Journal of Forecasting, 2025, by Luca Margaritella and Ovidijus Stauskas.

The programming language employed is predominantly MATLAB, with some R codes only to produce the graphs in the main paper. Throughout, we refer to the main paper as MP and to its online appendix as OA.

We start with a list of the scripts and data files found in this repository.
