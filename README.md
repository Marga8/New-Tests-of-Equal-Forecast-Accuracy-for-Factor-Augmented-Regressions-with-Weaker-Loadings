# New-Tests-of-Equal-Forecast-Accuracy-for-Factor-Augmented-Regressions-with-Weaker-Loadings

In this README file we explain in details how to reproduce both the simulations and the empirical results in "New Tests of Equal Forecast Accuracy for Factor Augmented Regressions with Weaker Loadings", International Journal of Forecasting, 2025, by Luca Margaritella and Ovidijus Stauskas.

The programming language employed is predominantly MATLAB, with some R codes only to produce the graphs in the main paper. 
The main bodies of the MATLAB scripts are taken and modified directly from the original scripts of J.Y. Pitarakis (see his two repos: https://github.com/jpitarakis/Predictive-Accuracy-Comparisons-Nested and https://github.com/jpitarakis/Multi-Step_Encompassing) who was the original mind behind the tests of forecasting accuracy and encompassing (see also [2], [3]).


Throughout, we refer to our main paper as MP and to its online appendix as OA.
